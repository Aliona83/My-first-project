                    The modern drinking fountain was invented and manufactured in the early
                     1900s by two men: Halsey Willard Taylor with the Halsey Taylor Company; 
                     and Luther Haws with the Haws Sanitary Drinking Faucet Co. These two 
                     companies changed how water was served in public places.

                    A fountain, from the Latin "fons" (genitive "fontis"), meaning source or spring,
                    is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. It is also a structure that jets water into 
                    the air for a decorative or dramatic effect.
