                    The modern drinking fountain was invented and manufactured in the early
                     1900s by two men: Halsey Willard Taylor with the Halsey Taylor Company; 
                     and Luther Haws with the Haws Sanitary Drinking Faucet Co. These two 
                     companies changed how water was served in public places.
